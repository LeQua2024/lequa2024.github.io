For a description of the [1st edition of this data challenge](https://lequa2022.github.io/), which took place in 2022, you are welcome to download one of the following papers:
1. Andrea Esuli, Alejandro Moreo, Fabrizio Sebastiani: [LeQua@CLEF2022: Learning to Quantify](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-99739-7_47). Proceedings of the 44th European Conference on Information Retrieval (ECIR 2022), Stavanger, NO, pp. 374-381. This is a concise description of the data challenge published before the submissions came in, and which thus focuses only on the setup of the data challenge and does not discuss the results and the submitting systems;

Andrea Esuli, Alejandro Moreo, Fabrizio Sebastiani, Gianluca Sperduti: [A Concise Overview of LeQua@CLEF 2022: Learning to Quantify](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-13643-6_23). Proceedings of the 13th Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF 2022), Bologna, IT, pp. 362-381. This is as paper (1) above, but published after the submissions came in, which means it also discusses the results and the submitting systems;

Working Notes of the 13th Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF 2022), Bologna, IT, pp. 1849-1868. This is as paper (2) above, but much more detailed.
