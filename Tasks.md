LeQua 2024 will offer four tasks (T1 to T4). For each such task, participants will be provided with datapoints already converted in vector form.

- **Task T1**: This task is concerned with evaluating **binary** quantifiers, i.e., quantifiers that must only predict the relative frequencies of a class and its complement; the data used are affected by **prior probability shift** (a.k.a. "label shift"). This task is akin to Task T1A of LeQua 2022.
- **Task T2**: This task is concerned with evaluating **single-label multi-class** quantifiers, i.e., quantifiers that operate on datapoints each belonging to exactly one among a set of n>2 classes; here too, the data used are affected by **prior probability shift**. This task is akin to Task T1B of LeQua 2022.
- **Task T3**: This task is concerned with evaluating **ordinal** quantifiers, i.e., quantifiers that operate on a set of n>2 totally ordered classes; here too, the data used are affected by **prior probability shift**. This task is new to LeQua 2024.
- **Task T4**: Like Task T1, this task is concerned with evaluating **binary** quantifiers; unlike in Task T1, the data used are affected by **covariate shift**. This task is new to LeQua 2024.

**For each task from T1 to T4, participant teams are not supposed to use (training / development / test) data other than those provided for that subtask.**

Register your team to participate in LeQua 2024 by filling [this form](https://forms.gle/1U8g9fP5qzzpF5TJ6). You may decide to participate in all four LeQua 2024 tasks or only in the ones you are most interested in. Please fill one form per team. There may be more than one team per institution, but a person can be a member of one LeQua 2024 team only.
