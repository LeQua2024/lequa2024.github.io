LeQua 2024 will offer four tasks (T1 to T4). For each such task, participants will be provided with datapoints already coverted in vector form.

- **Task T1**: This task is concerned with evaluating **binary** quantifiers, i.e., quantifiers that must only predict the relative frequencies of a class and its complement; the data used are affected by **prior probability shift** (a.k.a. "label shift"). This is the same as Task T1A of LeQua 2022, although different datapoints will be used.
- **Task T2**: This task is concerned with evaluating **single-label multi-class** quantifiers, i.e., quantifiers that operate on datapoints each belonging to exactly one among a set of n>2 classes; here too, the data used are affected by **prior probability shift**. This is the same as Task T1B of LeQua 2022, although different datapoints will be used.
- **Task T3**: This task is concerned with evaluating **ordinal** quantifiers, i.e., quantifiers that operate on a set of n>2 totally ordered classes; here too, the data used are affected by **prior probability shift**. This task is new to LeQua 2024.
- **Task T4**: Like Task T1, this task is concerned with evaluating **binary** quantifiers; unlike in Task T1, the data used are affected by **covariate shift**.

**For each task from T1 to T4, participant teams are not supposed to use (training / development / test) datapoints other than those provided for that subtask.**
